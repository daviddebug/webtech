2:A manifest file in HTML5 is a text file that describes the resources that are needed for a web application. It's a way to specify the files that should be loaded when the application is launched. This is useful for creating offline capable web applications. 

3. example of how to use microdata in HTML5. In this example , i'll create a recipe using the hRecipe microdata vocabulary:

<article>
<h1>My yummy chocolate chip cookie recipe</h1>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li><span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Ingredient">1 cup butter</span></li>
<li><span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Ingredient">2 cups sugar</span></li>
4.the following command line shows how to include audio and video in a web.

<audio src="song.mp3" controls></audio>
For video , you would use the <video> element , like this:
<video src="movie.mp4" controls></video>.
5:Tags and attributes are the building blocks of HTML. Tags are elements that define the structure of a web page , such as headings , paragraphs , and lists. Attributes are used to provide additional information about a tag , such as its style or behavior. For example , the <p> tag is used to create a paragraph , and the <p> tag can have attributes such as class , id , and style.
